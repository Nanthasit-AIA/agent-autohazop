    "process_description": "This P&ID represents the complete operational workflow for preparing, transferring, conditioning, and delivering high-concentration hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) for thrust testing. The process begins at the starting point zone—the 1000-liter SUS-316 main storage tank, which is first cleaned using deionized and de-oxygenated water supplied from the 1000-L H₂O tank. It ends at the catalyst bed, the final delivery point where conditioned H₂O₂ is supplied for reaction testing. The overall operation is carried out in four phases: (Phase-1) cleaning and preparation of the main tank using DI/DO water introduced through valve V-O and drained through V-D; (Phase-2) transferring H₂O₂ from 20-liter supply barrels into the 1000-L tank via valves V-V, V-I, and the vacuum system connected through V-R; (Phase-3) distributing H₂O₂ from the main tank into three 145-liter carbon-fiber storage tanks via valve V-05 while nitrogen pressurization (60–80 barA) maintains transfer flow; and (Phase-4) delivering pressurized peroxide high-concentration H₂O from the three 145-L tanks to the catalyst bed using high-pressure nitrogen propulsion (60–80 barA) propels the peroxide through the transfer lines, Differential pressure transmitters (P6 and P7) monitor and control the flow rate, while thermometer T1 and a CO₂-based cooling system regulate temperature to protect the catalyst from overheating. Once conditioned, the peroxide enters the catalyst bed, marking the completion of the test operation.",

    "process_description": "The Butene-2 tower C-220 is a 23.5 m tall, 2.6 m diameter distillation column that removes heavier components (mainly Butene-2 and n-Butane) from the lighter Butene-1 and Iso-butane stream. Feed enters mid-column from the upstream unit. Vapor rises to the top at ~66°C and 8.2 kg/cm²g, is totally condensed in the ground-mounted water-cooled condenser E-225, and the condensate is pushed by column pressure into the horizontal reflux drum V-225 (1.8 m ID × 3.81 m T-T, ~67°C).\nLiquid collected in V-225 is withdrawn by the duplicate centrifugal reflux pumps P225A/B (83 m³/h, 70.4 m head each). Part of the pump discharge is returned as reflux to the top of C-220 to control tower separation, while the net overhead product (rich in Butene-1) is sent forward to the Butene-1 column C-230. Reflux rate is manually adjusted based on laboratory analysis of a sample continuously taken from tray 117 via pumps P-221A/B, with the control target being ≤2% n-Butane in the overhead.\nBottom product containing heavy components is withdrawn at ~79°C, cooled in E-227, combined with MTBER, and routed to the refinery. AND Process Description: \"The purpose of the Butene-2 tower is to remove heavy boiling substances with boiling points higher than butene-1, mainly Butene-2 and N-Butane. The heavy boiling substances are discharged from the bottom of the B-2 tower, cooled by E-227, and then converged with MTBER and sent to the refinery. The top discharge of the Butene-2 tower is mainly Butene-1 and Iso-butane. The top discharge is cooled by cooling water in E-225 and then enters V-225. Part refluxes to the top of the C-220 tank, and part is discharged to C-230 (Butene-1 Column). The 117th tray of the tower uses Pump-221A/B to pump to the analysis room to analyze the components of N-Butene and Trans Butene-2. Currently, N-butane is controlled at 2% as the benchmark. When the analysis detects more than 2%, increase the top reflux flow; otherwise, decrease the reflux flow. The top cooler (E-225) is placed on the ground, and its condensate is squeezed out from the bottom by internal pressure in E-225 and enters the bottom of V-225.\"The section is fully instrumented with temperature, pressure, level, and flow controls, alarms, and safety relief valves as detailed in PIDs 2-04, 2-05, 2-06 and mainstream C4-009/C4-010. Also, examine the additional images highlighting streams in green labeled C4-009 and the main PFD image focusing on C-220, P225AB, and V-225.",

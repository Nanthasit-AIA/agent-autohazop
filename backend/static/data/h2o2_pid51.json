  "process_description": "This P&ID illustrates the operational procedure for preparing, transferring, and delivering high-concentration hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for thrust testing. The process is divided into five phases:Phase 1:The 1000-liter SUS-316 stainless-steel storage tank is thoroughly cleaned to remove impurities. Deionized (DI) and de-oxygenated (DO) water are sent from the 1000-L H₂O tank through the pump and valve V-O to rinse the H2O2 tank.The resulting wastewater is discharged through the drain line via valve V-D.Phase 2:Hydrogen peroxide from 20-liter supply barrels is transferred through valves V-V and V-I into the main 1000-L storage tank using a low-pressure vacuum system connected via valve V-R.Phase 3:H2O2 from the 1000-L tank is distributed into three parallel 145-liter carbon-fiber storage tanks lined with SUS-304 stainless steel via valve V-05. Nitrogen gas is introduced into the main tank to maintain pressurization for transfer(60–80 barA).Phase 4:In the final stage, high-concentration H₂O₂ is delivered from the three 145-L tanks to the catalyst bed for reaction testing. A high-pressure nitrogen system (60–80 barA) propels the peroxide through the transfer lines. Differential pressure transmitters (P6 and P7) monitor and control the flow rate, while thermometer T1 and a CO₂-based cooling system regulate temperature to protect the catalyst from overheating. Once conditioned, the peroxide enters the catalyst bed, marking the completion of the test operation.",
